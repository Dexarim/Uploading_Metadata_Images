# Uploading Metadata to Images

This script is designed to restore metadata (such as capture date, camera information, and GPS coordinates) in image and video files downloaded via [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/).

It reads ```.supplemental-metadata.json``` files, matches them with the corresponding media files, and embeds the metadata back into the mediaâ€”EXIF for images and container-level metadata for videos.

Supported formats include .jpg images and video files with extensions ```.mp4```, ```.mov```, and ```.avi```.
The processed files are saved in a separate restored folder within the specified directory.
